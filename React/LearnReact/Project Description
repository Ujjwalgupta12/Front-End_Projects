This is a React-based Todo App built using Material-UI for sleek and responsive UI components. The app fetches a list of todos from a public API 
(https://dummyjson.com/todos) and displays them in neatly organized cards with a consistent fixed size, ensuring a clean and uniform layout. 
Users can click on each todo itemâ€™s "View Details" button to open a dialog showing more information about the selected todo.

The project emphasizes:
Modern React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management and side effects.
Material-UI components for a professional and responsive design.
A fully responsive grid layout that adapts seamlessly across screen sizes.
Clean UX with loading skeletons and error handling.
Fixed-size todo cards for consistent visual structure.
This project is a great example of integrating external APIs, managing asynchronous data fetching, and implementing Material-UI design best practices in React.
